          <span>
            My Mom and my Grandmothers are my source of inspiration when it
            comes to cooking. I often fondly recollect how artistic they were in
            bringing together the various ingredients and cooking fabulous and
            healthy food for family and friends. And they were very adept at
            bringing the family members together into the process of cooking.
            The kitchen used to be the most used place in the house.<br /><br />
            Now, I continue the family tradition of enjoying cooking with my
            family :) and those are precious moments I rejoice.<br />
            <br />
            Recently, I have been inspired to pick up on techniques summarized
            under the OPOS umbrella. This helps me save time and energy on some
            elaborate traditional recipes which used to consume a lot more time
            and energy.
