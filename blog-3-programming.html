            BASIC was the first programming language I got introduced to. After
            that first executed successfully piece of code, there was no turning
            back!<br />
            I took to programming like a duck to water. I was craving for more
            and more exposure to programming, and today, I have contributed to
            developing applications for multiple surfaces including Mobile, Web
            and Desktop.<br />
            And I am craving for more everyday!<br />
            With umpteen opportunities in this world, both to learn and
            contribute, I am more excited than ever about programming!<br />
