          <span>
            American mythologist and author Joseph Campbell once said, “My
            general formula for my students is “Follow your bliss.” Find where
            it is, and don’t be afraid to follow it.”<br /><br />
            “Your ikigai is at the intersection of what you are good at and what
            you love doing,” says Hector Garcia, the co-author of Ikigai: The
            Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life. He writes,“Just as humans
            have lusted after objects and money since the dawn of time, other
            humans have felt dissatisfaction at the relentless pursuit of money
            and fame and have instead focused on something bigger than their own
            material wealth. This has over the years been described using many
            different words and practices, but always hearkening back to the
            central core of meaningfulness in life.”<br /><br />
            Growing up, I have always been interested in a broad spectrum of
            topics - poetry, gardening, books, music, art, programming, personal
            development, health, fitness, investing, and the list goes on...
            here is a snapshot of things that interest me...amidst which I have
            traveled in my quest for my Ikigai. I invite you to walk with me!
